      "description": ["üëã I'm Qing Lu. As a professional web developer, I have always been result-oriented and solution-oriented. In addition, I am good at thinking and have strong logical thinking skills, ","and I am especially passionate about using coding techniques and programming solutions. At the same time, I am still a creative and imaginative person, which is of great help to my work in UI/UX design. I am good at putting forward design plans and solutions with customers as the center. I can learn quickly and design scalable solutions to challenging problems, which will allow me to work as a front-end designer and developer. In terms of website design and development, I reckon that thinking and imagination are the prerequisites for doing things. The design and planning of the website is very important in the entire workflow. Because the correct design and planning of the website in advance can avoid losses caused by major problems in the later period. In addition, the design is to better serve users, both in terms of appearance and function. I firmly believe that good design will bring users a good mood and a more convenient lifestyle. I am full of enthusiasm for my career, and I hope to work hard to do everything well. I look forward to new things and new challenges, which can make me continue to improve and gradually become a leader.üíú"],
